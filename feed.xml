                <p>After having tried magnetic child locks we finally settled for pull latches for all our drawer and door locking needs. We think these are great for a couple of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>drawers are always locked when they are closed. no need to remember to close that push lock before you start your engine</li>
<li>slim overhang in the front (about 2mm) so that you can have drawers at a 90 degree angle</li>
<li>affordable</li>
<li>easy to install</li>
<li>decent quality, drawers stay shut when propertly installed</li>
<li>compatible with 30mm aluminium extrusion profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>In combination with these <a href="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/drawer-and-fridge-slides/">drawer and fridge slides</a> they make a perfect solution for soft closing, self retracting and automatically locking drawers.</p>

                <p>Cooking with an induction cooktup in a camper van is great. Heating up is quick, temperature regulation is instant and cleaning is easy as spilled liquids do not burn. When it comes to energy, things are not quite as simple, as turning electricity into heat comes wih a suboptimal efficiency. However, there are many things that you can do in order to get the most juice out of your battery.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9inpk740">Use one hob only</h2>
<p>We opted to install only one induction hob for multiple reasons. The required size of the electrical installation, the additional space requirements and the lack of space between hobs (leading to little to no room between pans and pots) are some of the reasons. But one reason was also energy efficiency. Even though induction hobs do not heat up like traditional electrical hobs, the pan or pot that is being heated does heat up the hob. Therefore, it is more energy efficient to cook on a single hob, making use of the otherwise wasted heat.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9iolfj41">Use residual heat</h2>
<p>Usually, we start our cooking sessions with our side dish (rice, noodles, lentils, potatoes, couscous, bulgur, quinoa...). We add the ingredients into cold water, it is not necessary to wait until the water is boiling. Once the water is boiling, we reduce the heat and leave the side dish cooking a certain number of minutes (this depends on the level of hardness of the food and needs some experimenting) and then remove the pot from the hob, leaving the contents to simmer while we turn our attention to the main dish.</p>
<p>As with the side dish, we usually add the main dish into the cold pan, as induction hobs heat up very quickly. One benefit is that you can toss your food into the pan right after you cut them, leaving more precious counter top space.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9iomkal2">Always use a lid</h2>
<p>This one is a no brainer, always use a lid to trap the heat. Try to minimize the number of times you have to remove the lid in order to stir or flip your food.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9iou7e03">Use pre cooked food</h2>
<p>We usually don't do this, as we believe fresh food to be healthier, but if you are really desperate to conserve your battery energy, you can use pre cooked food (potatoes, noodles etc) to save a lot of energy. So far we haven't been in the situation, but I think we would rather skip cooking altogether and go for a cold salad.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e9ipe9od5">Cook in bulk</h2>
<p>If you have a large pan, it might be advisable to cook your food for multiple days, especially when your weather forecast is not too sunny. This way you will only have to reheat during the cloudy or rainy days.</p>

The inverter has enough power for all of our 230V devices, like our induction cooktop, our electrical boiler. The charger is meant as a backup in case the solar panels do not produce enough energy, which has happened once while we were still building the van.</p>

                <p>Our solar setup consists of the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four 170Wp mono crystalline solar panels (<a href="https://amzn.to/2WpHTXv">Amazon.de</a>) for a total of 680Wp</li>
<li>700Wp MPPT charge controller (<a href="https://amzn.to/3c4MNzQ">Amazon.de</a>)</li>
<li>Extendable, reusable cable roof duct (<a href="https://amzn.to/3c5lMMv">Amazon.de</a>)</li>
<li>3N 30x30mm aluminium extrusion profiles (<a href="https://www.motedis.com/shop/Aluprofile/30-B-Typ-Nut-8/Aluprofil-30x30-3N-B-Typ-Nut-8::6.html">Motedis.de</a>)</li>
<li>Polymer based construction glue (<a href="https://amzn.to/2L2HjJO">Amazon.de</a>)</li>
<li>custom angle adapters made out of 30x30x3mm 90 degree angle aluminium bars (<a href="https://wilmsmetall.de/?page=bin/productview&amp;data=MWNlITFmNA==">example</a>)</li>
<li>6 sqmm cables (<a href="https://amzn.to/3fi9Xor">Amazon.de</a>)</li>
<li>emergency kill switch</li>
<li>fuses</li>
</ul>
<p>The size and amount of the solar panels was chosen to leave enough room for two roof windows. One 40x40cm window in the front with a vent (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Yx3Czq">Amazon.de</a>) and a 28x28cm window (<a href="https://amzn.to/35uPgBb">Amazon.de</a>) in the back. This setup allows for a nice cross ventilation while maximizing the total solar power without having to use an additional roof rack that would increase the vehicle height, weight, wind resistance and recognizability. Basically, this is the simplest and cheapest setup I could come up with that satisfies all our electrical, thermal and light requirements.</p>
<p>Most people buy their solar panels as a kit that comes with a cable roof duct and the construction glue. I advise against this, because the cable roof ducts are pure crap. They only allow a limited number of cables and cannot be opened at a later time in order to add an additional cable, which means you would have to drill another hole into your van. We have used an extendable, reusable cable roof duct and we have placed it below our solar panels, in order to maximize protection against rain. If you want to do this, make sure that you position the roof duct correctly, because the alumium extrusion profiles and the aluminium support of the solar panels can get in the way otherwise. We have inserted a total of five cables, two for the solar panels, two for the LTE antenna and one for the GPS antenna. The screws that hold the cover are protected against rain with simple duct tape.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/29/IMG_2997.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></p>
<p>The Fiat Ducato / Peugeot Boxer / Citroen Jumper/Relay come with mounting points for a roof rack. However, I have found these roof racks to be ridiculously expensive. Therefore, we decided to glue two simple 3N aluminium extrusion profiles to the sheet metal of the roof, which is both cheap and flexible due to the amount of mounting points in the aluminium extrusion profiles. The key is to make sure that the solar panels fit correctly by preparing everything on the floor. Once the aluminium extrusion profiles are glued to the metal you have very little time to make adjustments.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/29/camphoto_1254324197.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024"></p>
<p>You will need to create custom 90 degree angle adapters. This is both easy and cheap, even cheaper than buying ready to use angle adapters. Buy a 90 degree aluminium bar in your favorite local hardware store, cut it with a miter saw to the correct dimensions and drill a couple of 7mm holes to connect the aluminium extrusion profiles with the alumium mounting support of the solar panels using 6mm machine screws and spring washers. Spring washers are very important, as the vehicle constantly moves and you don't want your solar panels to fly off the roof while driving.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/29/camphoto_1483920592.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="4032"></p>
<p>After dry fitting everything together, think about how you want to connect your solar panels. We have four solar panels and we chose to wire them together in series and then in parallel, giving us the benefits of both worlds. Wiring in series means that the solar panels reach the minium charging voltage that the solar charge controller needs in order to start working early in the day. Amazingly, the solar charge controller starts working even before the sun goes up due to the reflections in the atmoshpere. Wiring all four solar panels in series would not have improved this any further, because once the voltage threshhold is reached, charging begins. Therefore we wired the two serial "panel pairs" together in parallel, so that we only loose half of our charging power if one of our solar panels is shadowed.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/29/solar-verkabelung.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="2151"></p>
<p>After the preparation it is time for the installation. Make sure to clean your roof thouroughly, using alcohol or another suitable cleaner. Dry fit your aluminium profiles and add your solar panels. Mark the position of the aluminium profiles with marking tape. Remove the solar panels and aluminium profiles. If your construction glue requires a primer, use a primer. If not, directly add the glue to the roof. Stick on your aluminium profiles on both sides of the vehicle. Remove the marking tape and immediately add the solar panels. This is necessary so that the glue is distributed evenly (the roof has a curvature, which the glue needs to even out). Make sure to connect all cables before fixing all panels in position with the machine screws and spring washers.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you do not distinguish charging and discharging circuits (most installations don't), wire in a kill switch into the positive line going to the solar charge controller. This allows you to disable your electric setup in case of troubleshooting. Otherwise, you may have electricity in your circuits even if your battery kill switch is activated. Also remember to use appropiately sized wires from the solar charge controller to the battery, as the solar charge controller typically decreases the voltage from the solar panels to the nominal 12V voltage of the battery bank, therefore requiring a larger wire diameter. Also wire in a fuse in accordance with the manual of the solar charge controller that you use.</p>

                <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Andalucía has it all: beaches, mountains, countryside, <i>pueblos blancos</i> and friendly people. It is also a region of wine, delicious food and flamenco. To get a taste of everything we tried to take our time with this roadtrip. However, even with around 20 days in Andalucía, we have not managed to finish our to do list.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this post, you will only find our favourite places where we have stopped on our way to Portugal. One little disclaimer: In case you were hoping to read something about the city of Málaga, Marbella or Nerja - we have to disappoint you. Since we both have been there before, on this trip we left it out to see more of the hilly inland. We can highly recommend visiting Málaga though, but you will not read about these places here. So without further ado, where have we been? </span></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e6lrq8oh0" class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Granada</strong></span></h2>
<p>Of course, everybody knows about the <strong>Alhambra</strong> and Generalife, the gardens surrounding Alhambra. This UNESCO World Heritage site is one of the most visited sites in all Spain. This time, we have not gone inside but instead enjoyed Granada on foot and by this, have only seen the Alhambra with the snowcapped Sierra Nevada in the background from a distance. Let me tell you: Granada is more than just the Alhambra. Especially barrio <strong>Albaicín </strong>(Albayzín) is really worth a stroll. </p>
<div class="gallery"   >
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/gallery/Alhambra.jpg" ><img src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/gallery/Alhambra-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Granada Alhambra view" width="720" height="720"></a></figure>
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/gallery/Granda-blick.jpg" ><img src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/gallery/Granda-blick-thumbnail.jpg" alt="Granada Albaicin" width="720" height="720"></a></figure>

</div>
<p class="p1">For a vegan treat, we found the little <strong>I Need __</strong> coffee shop. Delicious coffee and a really tasty ginger and walnut cake.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/coffee-granada-i-need.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000"></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e6lshqlu1" class="p1"><span class="s1">Ronda</span></h2>
<p>Ronda should be on your list for sure. Why? Well for one, the view of this village in the mountainous area is impressive. The center is divided by the Guadalevin river, which makes for the unique setting on top of <strong>El Tajo canyon</strong>. With the beautiful Puente Nuevo bridge the sight calls for many tourists each year. If you want to avoid other tourists at all costs, the city center of Ronda might not be for you. Instead, head for the rural surroundings where you can enjoy beautiful views of the bridge as well - in our opinion, even more beautiful. The region is perfect for little hikes, for example to Cueva del Gato. </p>
<div class="gallery"   >
<figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/gallery/ronda-view.jpg" ><img src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/gallery/ronda-view-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720"></a></figure>

</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Ronda, on the way down to the ocean again, there is another <em>pueblo blanco</em> we can recommend: <strong>Casares</strong> and with it, the nearby <em>Baños romanos de la Hedionda</em>. Stop there and take a quick sulphur bath - it is free, supposedly good for your health, around 20 degrees Celsius warm and at least in February there where only some locals around. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/banos-romanos.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000"></span></p>
<p id="mcetoc_1e6mhrioa0" class="p1">By the way, before we came to Ronda, we also visited little Iznajar. If you have endless time, Iznajar can be worth a trip. It is pretty, but pretty small, too. It can easily be explored in half a day.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e6lucmon0" class="p1"><span class="s1">Tarifa and La Pena</span></h2>
<p id="mcetoc_1e6lucspe1" class="p1"><span class="s1">Before we arrived in Tarifa, we spent some quiet days on the beach just before Gibraltar. Around Playa de la Alcaidesa you can park a van easily and enjoy the calm </span>Mediterranean <span class="s1">Sea. You can walk or jog along the beach up to Gibraltar, which we have done, but other than that, we stayed outside of this <em>British Overseas Territory. </em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/28/playa-gibraltar.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000"></em></span></p>
<p>So, after some much needed beach time, Tarifa was the next stop on our trip. Tarifa is quite nice, and I bet can be a lot of fun. However, in February almost everything was closed. Also, unfortunaltey, we do not yet know how to kitesurf. That is why we stayed not directly in Tarifa, but in the region of La Pena next to Tarifa with beaches, nature, animals and beautiful hikes. And it is true: You will wake up next to grazing cows. </p>

</div>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1e6mdo6pj0">Calas de Conil, Cádiz and Jerez</h2>
<p>Do not head directly to Sevilla. On your way up some pretty amazing spots await. Start by relaxing one day or two at Calas de Conil or Calas de Roche. Than enjoy culture and food in Cádiz. And end with sherry and music in Jerez de la Frontera.</p>

<p>Our highlight: vegan tapas! We can especially recommend the vegan food stall <em>Las ninas veganas</em>. It is located in the <em>Mercado Central </em>in <strong>Cadiz</strong><em> </em>and has the <strong>best vegan tapas</strong>: Spinach nuts and beet balls, Cauliflower balls with beet hummus, Aubergine balls ... just to name a few. Sooo good. And have some cold, local beer with the tapas. </p>

<p class="p1">Bright, colourful, lively. That is Sevilla, Andalusia’s capital. Here, you have it all: culture, museums, and architecture - the Cathedral, the Giralda, Plaza de Espana, or the palace complex Alcazár, just to name a few -, shopping possibilities, the river Guadalquivir with its lovely river banks and with a lot of water sports going on, green grassy chill out areas and electronic music festivals. </p>

                <p>We spent a lot of time thinking about the security of our van. It is important for us to feel safe both inside the vehicle and when we are enjoying the outdoors. We figured that it is worth spending a bit more on this subject because the van will be our home for the near future and we don't want anybody entering our home or worse, stealing it entirely.</p>
<p>The vehicle specific tips in the video should work for any of the following vans built after 2006:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiat Ducato</li>
<li>Citroen Jumper or Citroen Relay</li>
<li>Peugeot Boxer</li>
<li>Ram Promaster</li>

                    <img src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/22/shower-curtain.JPG" alt="" />
                <p>The idea behind our shower is simple. <em>What is the minimal amount of space that you need in order to comfortably get clean in a van?</em> There are many different answers to this problem. We chose to build a <strong>waist high shower box</strong> that serves as storage for dirty laundry and as an extension of our kitchen countertop when the shower is not in use, which is... 99% of the time. We feel like this way we don't waste any space for the little amount of time that we actually spend showering.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Some links may be affiliate links and if you go through them to make a purchase we will earn a commission<strong> </strong>– at no extra cost to you.</p>
<p>Our shower box is 70cm wide, 60cm deep and about 70cm tall. We <strong>raised the bottom</strong> of the shower box about 20cm in order to make room for water pipes, wires and air pipes, so that the top of our shower box aligns with the rest of the kitchen countertop, which sits at about 90cm. The raised bottom also helps in getting in and out of the shower, because you don't need to raise your leg that high. The box is slightly wider than it is deep in order to take into accocunt the curved walls of the van. You may need to adjust these measurements to your situation.</p>
<p>The first step was to <strong>cut the bottom and side pieces</strong> out of 15mm lightweight plywood to the desired dimensions. We then <strong>routered grooves</strong> into the plywood for the <strong>magnets </strong>(<a href="https://amzn.to/2J5Naxb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/39cZAOp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.de</a>) that will ensure that the shower curtain does not cling to your body when the hot steam of the shower rises to the top. After that, we assembled the basic box with screws and wood glue using clamps and custom made 90 degree helpers.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/22/build-a-box-small.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="583"></p>
<p>The next step was to make the box as water tight as possible by applying some sort of primer and multiple layers of a liquid waterproofing membrane. For the edges, we used the additional reinforcements that came with our <strong>waterproofing kit </strong>(<a href="https://amzn.to/3acpZNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/3bj1vm6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.de</a>).</p>
<p><img class="post__image align-left" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/22/waterproof2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="560"></p>
<p>After that we ordered a <strong><a href="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/individual-sized-shower-tub/">custom size shower tub</a></strong> that comes with a drainage outlet and siphon. This piece of hardware is built according to your dimensions and preferences. Make sure to measure accurately, as you want it to fit inside the box without any gaps. Alternatively, you can order this first and build your box around this, which should make it a little easier.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/22/add-a-shower-tub.small.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="665"></p>
<p>After that we <strong>inserted the magnets</strong> into the grooves that we had previously routered and then we glued four 1.5mm <strong>stainless steel sheets</strong> to the inner walls of the box using a polyurethane industrial adhesive (<a href="https://amzn.to/2U5rxTW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.com</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/2U7trU8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon.de</a>). Finally, we <strong>siliconed all the edges</strong> in order to prevent any water from leaking. If any water manages to find its way through the cracks, the liquid waterproofing membrane will prevent it from penetrating into the wood.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/22/side-walls.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="465"></p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>shower curtain</strong> was modified to include some magnets in the correct positions (matching the magnets in the shower box and in the wood ceiling) and it was also shortened so that it only covers the necessary parts. All in all, we used roughly 50 magnets in the ceiling, the shower box and the curtain.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://twoandahalfvan.github.io/media/posts/22/IMG_3434.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="665"></p>
<p>There you have it, a minimal DIY shower that is easy to build and gets out of your way when you don't need it.</p>

This was a very important step for us, as we wanted to have a full size lengthwise bed and side by side seating, even in the winter. Also the shower and the toilet were a must have. After many iterations, we finally found the perfect solution for our needs and we are very happy that we implemented this somewhat unconventional layout.</p>

                <p>We use standard size boxes (called Euro Boxes) with a side door for easy access when the boxes are stacked. This is both practical and weight saving, as you only need one set of heavy duty slides. We like these boxes as it keeps the garage organised with a minimal amount of effort while giving you a good overview due to the transparent sides.</p>

<p>USA: Unfortunately the Euro Box system is not established in the USA. There seems to be a high demand for these boxes, so if you are interested in trading them in bulk and have experience in importing larger quantities, let us know and we will get you the contact details from the manufacturer.</p>
